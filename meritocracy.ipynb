    "With a distribution of 50% \"normal\", 25% \"overachiever\" and 25% \"charismatic_idiot\" random teams with a size of 5 persons are formed. A group competition is held between every 4 teams, where the best team wins and the other 3 groups lose. The losing teams review their workflows and learn from their loss, resulting in a 10% increase of their current individual performance (includind the effects of other team members on them) for all team members. Each winning team is awarded one promotion and the candidate is chosen by the best individual performance. However, the \"charismatic_idiot\" obtains a specific promotion bonus of +2 points added to his performance, due to his rhetoric abilities and good reputation. When a \"charismatic_idiot\" or an \"overachiever\" leaves a group, their corresponding effect on other team memebers is additively reversed (leaving behind their influence on either increased or decreased learning).\n",
